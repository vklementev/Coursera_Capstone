In my project I’m going to analyze data on Moscow districts. I would like to analyze Moscow foursquare data on macro level 
as well as to analyze some socioeconomic indicators related to these districts (population, real estate price, 
office,work/residential district). After i get information on socioeconomic indicators in the format i need, as well as i conduct 
the analysis of foursquare data using clustering, i'm going to integrate foursquare results analysis with socioeconomic indicators 
in order to get explanations why in cartain districts such a venues are the most popular.

I hope that economic indicators will be helpful to explain information on foursquare venues that are typical for certain district. 
The information I get will be helpful to find similarities among districts, benchmark the most popular districts venues and 
elicit some new business opportunities based on absence/presence of venues in similar districts. I also hope that combination of 
some statistics information with Foursquare data would be unique to some extent.

Interested parties for this research could be persons who study city environments to develop their business (e.g. to find two 
districts with similar socio-economic features and reveal that some venues that are very popular in one district could also be 
popular for another same one), locals who will confirm their intuitive knowledge they have already got because they are living 
in these district for a while and see that e.g. coffee shops are very popular in some district and any person who would like to 
learn some features of Moscow and how different its districts are. Interested parties for this research could also be sociologists 
who study city environments. Nowadays Moscow is rapidly changing and there is high attention for urban studies there. There are 
119 districts that I’m going to analyze and I hope some insights into this area will make a little contribution into knowledge of 
current state of affairs in Moscow.
