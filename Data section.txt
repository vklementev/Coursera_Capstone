For my research I choose the following socioeconomic indicators to analyze: 
- population of every district (Source – Wikipedia, there is a list of Moscow districts and their population, in Russian only, 
https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BA_%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2_%D0%B8_%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%9C%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B2%D1%8B), 
- real estate prices per sq m for every district (there is web-site with information in Russian only, https://www.irn.ru/rating/moscow/), 
- the estimation of whether the district in mostly consists of office and workplaces or is residential area (there was a research made 
by Yandex where they estimate what percentage of people living in certain district constantly and what percentage are moving daily to 
work and back home, https://cache-spb02.cdn.yandex.net/download.yandex.ru/company/figures/2016/home_work/districts_f.html). 

To get population and real estate prices data I’m going to use web scrapping, for work/home data I collect information manually. 
I was trying to translate names of districts in English using Jupyter commands but it was in vain so that I made this translation manually. 

This data will help to sort district on business/residential and sort them based on real estate prices and its population. I hope this 
information will be helpful to explain why certain types of Foursquare venues are popular in some districts e.g. I expect supermarkets to be 
popular in the residential areas whether in business locations coffee shops or restaurants will be on the top. There will be information on 
119 districts of Moscow and more then 2,500 foursquare venues to analyze. Clustering and closeness in socioeconomic features i've listed 
will show how districts are similar and different among each other and what business needs could be implemented there. 
Analysis will be held in table format in dataframes and folium maps.

In overall i plan that clustering Foursquare data on Moscow districts on the one side and socioeconomic indicators groupings on the other side 
will give a sufficient characteristic of very Moscow district.
